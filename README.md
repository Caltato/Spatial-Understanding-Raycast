# Spatial-Understanding-Raycast
Things to note:
This raycast should only be done after Spatial Understanding is done scanning the room.
You may include a public SurfaceMask in your classes and untick the surfaces that you want the raycast to ignore.
Raycsts also can have an out parameter of type RaycastHit_SU that returns the surfaceType, point of hit and distance
